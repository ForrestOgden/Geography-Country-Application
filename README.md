# Geography-Country-Application

A web-app that will allow you to peruse the earth on a map and click any country to instantly get its location.

Select a country from the list on the left and watch the data populate! You can scroll down for a generated list of images of each country, respectively!

For instance, when selecting the country of Greece, you'll get data related to:
- capital city
- population
- region
- subregion
- currency
- country flag

and then, in addition (if you scroll down), you will get to see pictures of the land and people related to that country.

Don't forget that the map in the upper-right portion will also navigate to the country for you and you can then inspect the topography and individual cities or neighboring countries!

This project was something I really did for people who love exploring cultures and Geography, but it can also be a really useful for school projects related to Geography, Humanities, or even History.
